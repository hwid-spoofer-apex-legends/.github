## 🔍 What Is an HWID Spoofer?

HWID = **Hardware ID** — unique codes tied to your CPU, GPU, drives, motherboard, and MAC address. Anti-cheat systems log these when banning players. A **HWID spoofer** changes or masks those values, making you look like a totally different device.

It’s the only way to **bypass Apex's hardware-level ban** and stay off EA’s blacklist.
